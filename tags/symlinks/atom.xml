        wide links = yes
        allow insecure wide links = yes
    ## Browsing&#x2F;Identification ###

    # Change this to the workgroup&#x2F;NT-domain name your Samba server will part of
        workgroup = WORKGROUP

    # server string is the equivalent of the NT Description field
        server string = %h server (Samba, Ubuntu)

    # Windows Internet Name Serving Support Section:
    # WINS Support - Tells the NMBD component of Samba to enable its WINS Server
    #   wins support = no

    # WINS Server - Tells the NMBD components of Samba to be a WINS Client
    # Note: Samba can be either a WINS Server, or a WINS Client, but NOT both
    ;   wins server = w.x.y.z

    # This will prevent nmbd to search for NetBIOS names through DNS.
        dns proxy = no

    #### Networking ####

    # The specific set of interfaces &#x2F; networks to bind to
    # This can be either the interface name or an IP address&#x2F;netmask;
    # interface names are normally preferred
    ;   interfaces = 127.0.0.0&#x2F;8 eth0

    # Only bind to the named interfaces and&#x2F;or networks; you must use the
    # &#x27;interfaces&#x27; option above to use this.
    # It is recommended that you enable this feature if your Samba machine is
    # not protected by a firewall or is a firewall itself.  However, this
    # option cannot handle dynamic or non-broadcast interfaces correctly.
    ;   bind interfaces only = yes



    #### Debugging&#x2F;Accounting ####

    # This tells Samba to use a separate log file for each machine
    # that connects
        log file = &#x2F;var&#x2F;log&#x2F;samba&#x2F;log.%m

    # Cap the size of the individual log files (in KiB).
        max log size = 1000

    # If you want Samba to only log through syslog then set the following
    # parameter to &#x27;yes&#x27;.
    #   syslog only = no

    # We want Samba to log a minimum amount of information to syslog. Everything
    # should go to &#x2F;var&#x2F;log&#x2F;samba&#x2F;log.{smbd,nmbd} instead. If you want to log
    # through syslog you should set the following parameter to something higher.
        syslog = 0

    # Do something sensible when Samba crashes: mail the admin a backtrace
        panic action = &#x2F;usr&#x2F;share&#x2F;samba&#x2F;panic-action %d


    ####### Authentication #######

    # Server role. Defines in which mode Samba will operate. Possible
    # values are &quot;standalone server&quot;, &quot;member server&quot;, &quot;classic primary
    # domain controller&quot;, &quot;classic backup domain controller&quot;, &quot;active
    # directory domain controller&quot;. 
    #
    # Most people will want &quot;standalone sever&quot; or &quot;member server&quot;.
    # Running as &quot;active directory domain controller&quot; will require first
    # running &quot;samba-tool domain provision&quot; to wipe databases and create a
    # new domain.
        server role = standalone server

    # If you are using encrypted passwords, Samba will need to know what
    # password database type you are using.  
        passdb backend = tdbsam

        obey pam restrictions = yes

    # This boolean parameter controls whether Samba attempts to sync the Unix
    # password with the SMB password when the encrypted SMB password in the
    # passdb is changed.
        unix password sync = yes

    # For Unix password sync to work on a Debian GNU&#x2F;Linux system, the following
    # parameters must be set (thanks to Ian Kahan &lt;&lt;kahan@informatik.tu-muenchen.de&gt; for
    # sending the correct chat script for the passwd program in Debian Sarge).
        passwd program = &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;passwd %u
        passwd chat = *Enter\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *Retype\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *password\supdated\ssuccessfully* .

    # This boolean controls whether PAM will be used for password changes
    # when requested by an SMB client instead of the program listed in
    # &#x27;passwd program&#x27;. The default is &#x27;no&#x27;.
        pam password change = yes

    # This option controls how unsuccessful authentication attempts are mapped
    # to anonymous connections
        map to guest = bad user
